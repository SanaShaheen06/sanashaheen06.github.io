    <!-- Section 3: The Full Story -->
    <section class="project-narrative-full">
        <h2>The Goal</h2>
        <p>Our primary objective was to deploy an enterprise-grade messaging platform that was both resilient and secure. This meant it couldn't have single points of failure. The system required a redundant database, multiple application servers, and centralized user management that connected to our company's Active Directory.</p>
        
        <h2>My Solution & Process</h2>
        <p>I began by configuring two Windows Server 2019 machines as Domain Controllers to handle LDAP authentication and DNS. For database redundancy, I deployed a three-server MongoDB replica set on Ubuntu, ensuring that if one database server failed, the others would take over instantly. Next, I set up two separate Ubuntu servers for the Rocket.Chat application itself, using PM2 to manage the Node.js processes and ensure they were always running.</p>
        <p>To secure the platform and distribute user traffic, I installed and configured NGINX as a reverse proxy. This handled all incoming HTTPS traffic, encrypting communications, and load-balancing requests between the two Rocket.Chat servers. Finally, I integrated Rocket.Chat with Active Directory using LDAP, which allowed users to log in with their existing company credentials.</p>

        <!-- NEW: Added a dedicated results section -->
        <div class="project-results">
            <h2>ðŸ§ª Testing & Results</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>âœ… Successfully authenticated domain users via Rocket.Chat using LDAP.</li>
                <li>âœ… Verified real-time messaging and channel communication between users.</li>
                <li>âœ… Confirmed that the MongoDB replica set failover worked seamlessly during tests.</li>
                <li>âœ… Validated that NGINX correctly distributed traffic between Rocket.Chat servers.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <h2>ðŸ’¡ Key Takeaways</h2>
        <p>This project was invaluable for gaining hands-on experience in deploying a fault-tolerant, scalable infrastructure. It deepened my understanding of Linux administration, Active Directory integration, service redundancy using replica sets and reverse proxies, and the importance of secure communication protocols in a team environment.</p>
