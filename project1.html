      <h1>High-Availability Hybrid Infrastructure</h1>
      <p class="project-summary">
        This capstone project focused on designing and deploying a secure, high-availability hybrid IT infrastructure for a simulated multinational organization with two major sites — New York (Headquarters) and Hong Kong (Branch Office). The objective was to build a reliable and scalable environment supporting collaboration, helpdesk, and monitoring services across both locations.
      </p>

      <h2>Key Goals</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Establish a redundant Active Directory environment for centralized user management.</li>
        <li>Deploy high-availability Linux and Windows services across two sites.</li>
        <li>Implement secure communication, user authentication, and role-based access between locations.</li>
        <li>Ensure service continuity and fault tolerance through redundancy and replication mechanisms.</li>

        <h3>My Role & Responsibilities</h3>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem; opacity: 0.8;">My role focused on the Hong Kong domain (Capstone.hk), where I:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Configured Primary Domain Controller (DC1) and Secondary Domain Controller (DC2) for redundancy and load balancing.</li>
          <li>Installed and configured Linux-based DHCP server to assign and manage IP addresses dynamically.</li>
          <li>Established two-way trust between Hong Kong and New York domains for cross-domain authentication.</li>
          <li>Created and managed user accounts, security groups, and organizational units (OUs) through Active Directory.</li>
          <li>Applied Group Policy Objects (GPOs) to enforce security settings and resource access controls.</li>
          <li>Assisted in integrating Active Directory authentication with Mattermost and Zammad for single sign-on (SSO).</li>
          <li>Deployed Nagios for server and network monitoring between sites.</li>
          <li>Created detailed documentation of network topology, configurations, and recovery procedures.</li>

    <!-- Section 3: Full Narrative -->
    <section class="project-narrative-full">
      <h2>The Goal</h2>
      <p>The core objective was to build a realistic, multi-site IT environment from scratch. This required creating two distinct but interconnected domains (New York and Hong Kong) to simulate a global enterprise, ensuring centralized user management and secure integration of both Windows and Linux applications.</p>

      <h2>My Solution & Process</h2>
      <p>My work centered on the Hong Kong domain. I began by deploying <strong>Active Directory</strong> and <strong>DHCP</strong> on Windows Server, establishing the foundation for user and device management. Using <strong>Group Policy Objects (GPOs)</strong>, I enforced security settings and standardized user environments. A critical milestone was configuring a <strong>domain trust</strong> with the New York site, enabling seamless cross-domain resource access.</p>
      <p>A key feature of this project was cross-platform integration. I successfully integrated several Linux-based services into the Windows AD environment, including a <strong>Zammad ticketing system</strong> and a <strong>Nagios monitoring server</strong>, demonstrating that open-source tools could function securely within a Microsoft-centric infrastructure.</p>

      <h2>Detailed Overview</h2>
      <p>The project involved designing a high-availability infrastructure leveraging both Windows and Linux systems. Redundant domain controllers were deployed for load balancing, while DHCP and DNS services ensured consistent IP and name resolution across both locations. Group policies were implemented for security baselines, login control, and system updates.</p>
      <p>For collaboration and IT service management, <strong>Mattermost</strong> was deployed as an enterprise messaging platform and <strong>Zammad</strong> as the helpdesk solution, both backed by <strong>PostgreSQL</strong> databases. Monitoring was handled via <strong>Nagios</strong>, which provided real-time alerts on server health, disk usage, and network latency.</p>
      <p>To enhance security, planning for <strong>Active Directory Certificate Services (ADCS)</strong> was included for certificate-based authentication and encryption. The entire setup ran on <strong>VMware vSphere</strong>, allowing for isolated testing, scalability, and resource management.</p>

      <h2>Outcomes & Results</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Successfully deployed a fully functional hybrid IT environment connecting New York and Hong Kong domains.</li>
        <li>Implemented domain trust and centralized authentication across sites.</li>
        <li>Achieved redundancy through multi-server architecture and DNS replication.</li>
        <li>Integrated open-source and Microsoft services securely and efficiently.</li>
        <li>Produced comprehensive documentation and topology diagrams for assessment.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
      <p>This project strengthened my skills in infrastructure deployment, cross-platform integration, and troubleshooting complex authentication issues between systems. It emphasized the value of meticulous planning, redundancy, and monitoring in maintaining a resilient multi-site network.</p>
