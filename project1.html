      <h1>High-Availability Hybrid IT Infrastructure</h1>
      <p class="project-summary">
        As part of my final semester at Conestoga College, I collaborated with a team of 4 to plan, design, and deploy a high-availability hybrid IT infrastructure for a simulated global organization with sites in New York and Hong Kong.

    <!-- Section 3: The Full Story (Narrative version of your text) -->
    <section class="project-narrative-full">
        <h2>The Goal</h2>
        <p>The objective was to build a realistic, multi-site IT environment that mirrored a real-world enterprise. The key requirements were to establish two separate but connected domains (New York and Hong Kong), ensure users could be managed centrally, and integrate both Windows-native and Linux-based applications securely.</p>
        
        <h2>My Solution & Process</h2>
        <p>Working on the Hong Kong domain, my first step was to deploy Active Directory Domain Services (ADDS) and DHCP on a Windows Server 2019 instance within our VMware vSphere environment. This created the foundation for user and machine management.</p>
        <p>With the domain established, I implemented several Group Policy Objects (GPOs) to enforce security settings and manage user access to resources. A critical part of the project was establishing an inter-site trust relationship with the New York domain, allowing for cross-domain authentication and resource access.</p>
        <p>The most interesting part was the cross-platform integration. I successfully connected several Linux-based services into our Windows environment: a Zammad ticketing system for IT support, a Nagios server for infrastructure monitoring, and a Mattermost server for team collaboration. To secure access, I configured our web services to use HTTPS, leveraging Active Directory Certificate Services (ADCS) to issue and manage certificates for authentication.</p>

        <h2>Outcomes & Lessons Learned</h2>
        <p>This project was a success and provided invaluable hands-on experience. It significantly strengthened my skills in infrastructure deployment, cross-platform integration, system hardening, and teamwork. I learned how to troubleshoot complex connectivity issues between different operating systems and the importance of careful planning in a multi-site network.</p>
