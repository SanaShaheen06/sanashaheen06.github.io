      <h1>High-Availability Hybrid IT Infrastructure Deployment</h1>
      <p class="project-summary">
        This project involved designing and deploying a secure, high-availability hybrid IT infrastructure for a simulated multinational organization with two sites — New York (Headquarters) and Hong Kong (Branch Office). The goal was to create a scalable and fault-tolerant environment supporting collaboration, helpdesk, and monitoring services across both locations.
      </p>

      <h2>Key Objectives</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Build a redundant Active Directory environment for centralized user management.</li>
        <li>Deploy Linux and Windows services with high availability and failover capabilities.</li>
        <li>Enable secure communication, authentication, and cross-domain trust between both sites.</li>
        <li>Implement monitoring, role-based access, and documentation for operational efficiency.</li>
      </ul>

        <h3>My Role & Responsibilities</h3>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem; opacity: 0.8;">I managed the Hong Kong domain (Capstone.hk) and handled key server and network configurations:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Deployed Primary and Secondary Domain Controllers (DC1, DC2) for redundancy and load balancing.</li>
          <li>Installed and configured a Linux-based DHCP server for automatic IP management.</li>
          <li>Established a two-way trust with the New York domain for secure resource sharing.</li>
          <li>Managed users, groups, and Organizational Units (OUs) within Active Directory.</li>
          <li>Applied Group Policy Objects (GPOs) for security, access control, and standardization.</li>
          <li>Integrated Active Directory authentication with Mattermost and Zammad (SSO support).</li>
          <li>Deployed Nagios for monitoring uptime, server health, and inter-site connectivity.</li>
          <li>Created detailed documentation including network diagrams, configurations, and recovery steps.</li>
        </ul>

      <h2>Project Execution</h2>
      <p>The project simulated a global enterprise setup. I deployed and configured the Hong Kong domain to communicate securely with the New York site through trust relationships. Services like DHCP, DNS, and GPOs were configured to automate and secure network management. Linux-based applications, including Zammad (ticketing system) and Nagios (monitoring tool), were integrated with the Windows infrastructure, demonstrating seamless cross-platform compatibility.</p>
      <p>For collaboration, Mattermost was implemented and connected with Active Directory for centralized login management. VMware vSphere provided virtualization for testing, scalability, and fault tolerance across servers. To strengthen security, planning was completed for deploying Active Directory Certificate Services (ADCS) for certificate-based authentication.</p>

      <h2>Outcomes & Impact</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Successfully built a functioning hybrid IT infrastructure connecting two geographic sites.</li>
        <li>Established centralized authentication with domain trust and redundancy.</li>
        <li>Integrated Linux and Windows systems securely within one unified environment.</li>
        <li>Implemented continuous system monitoring and proactive alerting using Nagios.</li>
        <li>Produced clear, professional technical documentation and topology reports.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Key Learnings</h2>
      <p>This project enhanced my expertise in network configuration, Windows and Linux server management, and multi-site system design. It improved my ability to troubleshoot cross-platform authentication, enforce security policies, and document enterprise-grade infrastructure deployments.</p>
